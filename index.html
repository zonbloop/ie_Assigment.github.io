							<h2>Insurance credit information systems</h2>
						</header>
						<p>Blockchain 
							is basically a very large database in which you only need the ID in order
							to access the block that has the information from the insured, the insurer 
							can control the big data and establish the ownership, check health record or
							making a request about any particular property that is related to the 
							insured. In this way, the insurer can establish a better way to discern 
							if a customer is making fraud.

							<h2>Financial transactions</h2>

						<p>On the other hand, the fact that directories could leverage the technology’s 
							decentralized consensus protocols to allow providers and insurers to update 
							listings more quickly and easily would make a great impact on how we see those 
							boring transactions, in fact, we could imagine an insurance transaction that only 
							could need a click on our smartphone with a quick response in minutes.

							In fact, in our current COVID-19 pandemic this could reduce the curve of infections 
							and improve the efficiency of supply-chain finance to their customer.

						<h2>Reinsurance</h2>
					</header>
					<p>The mixture between Blockchain and Big Data could allow automating risk modeling to know 
						the probability of the amount of money that could be lost in the future, making, as we 
						already deduce, a smart contract that fits with the needs of the customer.

						<h2>Peer-to-Peer insurance</h2>
					</header>
					<p>Blockchain technology can drastically reduce manual interventions and employ smart contracts 
						in order to digitalize procedures that rely heavily on paperwork. Providing an easier-to-access, 
						more comprehensive set of medical, property, or life records on a blockchain could infuse comfort 
						and peace of mind into what, for many, is now an intrusive and often discouraging application process.

						Blockchain could enhance existing P2P models in order to fund better insurance contracts, and at the same time, decide particular tokens.

							<h2>Conclusion</h2>
							<p>Blockchain’s added security and ability to establish trust between entities are two reasons why it can help solve the interoperability
								 problem better than today’s existing technologies, these beneﬁts of establishing an interoperable, comprehensive health record, both 
								 in the short and long term, should push stakeholders to explore this technology and may impact how insurance information exchanges operate in the future.</p>
